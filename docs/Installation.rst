Installing the Package
========================

To install this package you can use `pip`, if you wish to use an alternative
package installation method then please adjust the commands appropriately, but
we cannot provide support for all package managers/installation methods. 

We can install the package using the following command using ssh::

     pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/UofGAnalytics/PythonODLAssessInternal

You can also install via https using the following command::

     pip install git+https://github.com/UofGAnalytics/PythonODLAssessInternal


In a terminal window for your current version of python. 

If you are in a Colab/Jupyter you can use an `!` in front of the command in the
first cell which will install the package.

If you are working with conda or virtualenv or otherwise you may wish to make a
new environment for this project to avoid having our assessment library in your
standard install. 

Although it might be worth exploring installing packages yourself if you have
not done this before in Python.
