Installing the Package
========================

To install this package you can use `pip`, if you wish to use an alternative
package installation method then please adjust the commands appropriately, but
we cannot provide support for all package managers/installation methods. 

We can install the package using the following command::

      pip install git+ABCD

In a terminal which for your current version of python. 

If you are in a Colab you can use an `!` in front of the command which will
install the package.
In addition for ease we have constructed a Google Colab will install the
package to make it easier to use. Although it might be worth exploring 
installing packages yourself if you have not done this before in Python.
